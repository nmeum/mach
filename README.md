# mach

A WiP implementation of `make(1)`, aims to be compatible with [P1003.1â„¢-202x/D3][posix draft] at some point.

## Status

Proof of concept, currently largely untested, buggy, and incomplete.

## Installation

This software is designed to work with GHC 9.4.7 without requiring any external dependency, i.e. only relying on the bundled library versions.
If this GHC version is installed, mach can be installed by cloning the repository and running the following command from the repository root:

    $ cabal install
